        Accessibility in web development is the practice of making websites usable by as many people as possible.
        <br> It means creating a website that provides a good experience for everyone, regardless of how they must access the internet. <br>
Accessibility benefits other groups such as those using mobile devices, or those with slow network connections. <br> It also helps ensure that people with physical disabilities, situational disabilities, and socio-economic restrictions on bandwidth and speed can interact with websites. <br> 
Accessibility means making your content and design clear and simple enough so that most people can use it without needing to adapt it. <br> It also means supporting those who do need to adapt things. 
<br> Some examples of disabilities include: Visual impairments, Hearing impairments, Mobility impairments, Cognitive impairments.
