    <h1>features of html 5</h1>
    <h3> Semantic Elements </h3>

When constructing an HTML script, the term “semantic” refers to the meaning of the text. Semantics, to put it simply, is the use of HTML tags that accurately reflect the content they contain. For instance, using the <div> tag doesn’t suggest the content it will carry, however using the <p> tag suggests it can be used to hold paragraph information. 
There are a lot of reasons why you should write Semantic tags instead of normal HTML tags, to leverage SEO, accessibility, and browser compatibility. 
<h3>audio and video supports</h3>
One of the many HTML 5 features is the support for audio and video. It has reduced the hassle of relying upon third-party services such as Adobe Flash player. To embed Audio and Video into your HTML document, you may use the following two tags, <audio> and <video> tags. 
    These two tags are launched with the release of HTML 5 and support a numerous range of attributes such as height, width, and more that offers developers to leverage the customization of HTML documents. 
<h3>Canvas Elements</h3>
Canvas Elements is a top-notch feature that has made the tedious task of handling graphics easier for developers. With the help of Canvas elements, you can easily draw graphics using JavaScript. It is optimum for creating simple animations and drawing photo compositions. 
To initialize the Canvas element <canvas> tag is used with only two specific attributes, width and height. Once, the element is initialized, it is then taken care of with the help of JavaScript to draw shapes, lines, images, and more.
